# Recommendation Systems and Image Quantization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with two applied machine learning projects focused on real-world datasets and unsupervised learning techniques.

---

## Project A: Recommendation System

In this project, a movie recommendation system is developed using the **MovieLens 100K dataset**. The dataset includes user–movie ratings, movie metadata (such as genres), and user demographic information.

### Objectives
- Analyze user-item interactions
- Explore recommendation system strategies
- Understand how personalization can be achieved from historical data

### Recommendation Approaches
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on item features and user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses similarities between users or items based on ratings.
- **Hybrid Methods:** Combines content-based and collaborative approaches.

## Project B: Image Quantization

This project focuses on **image quantization**, the process of reducing the number of colors in an image while preserving visual quality.

### Objectives
- Apply unsupervised clustering algorithms for color reduction
- Perform image quantization on famous artworks
- Evaluate clustering performance using quantization error metrics

### Applications
- Image compression
- Visualization on limited-color devices
- Artistic and stylized image effects

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / image processing libraries

All experiments, results, and discussions are documented within the Jupyter Notebook.
